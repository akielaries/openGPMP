# Overview
Work in progress repository turning the original Python based projects for 
CS 499 Contemporary Developments, Deep Learning, into a reusable C++ package. 

Implementation of several statistical algorithms used for deep learning. 

# Methods
## Cross Validation
A resampling technique, the idea of this method is to train our model by utilizing 
the subsets of our data set then proceeding to evaluate + compare against the original.
Essentially, use some part(s) of the data set for training, other part(s) for testing.

#### K-Fold Cross Validation
Split our data into a `k` number of subsets also called folds, and perform
training/learning on the subsets leaving one `(k - 1)` for the final evaluation of 
the trained model. The method involves iterating `k` number of times using a different
fold each time for testing against.
