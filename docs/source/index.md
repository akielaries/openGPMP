Welcome to openGPMP's documentation.
===================================
**openGPMP** is an open-source, multi-threaded capable, general purpose mathematics package written in C++ with
a primary focus on Numbery Theory and Cryptographic algorithms, Linear Algebra, and Machine/Deep learning concepts
as well as a range of language API's with zero dependencies. openGPMP aims to provide options for pre-built functions, 
models, etc. along with modularity for user freedom.
Look in the [samples](https://github.com/akielaries/openGPMP/tree/main/samples) folder for examples
on how to use some of openGPMP's functionalities.

This documentation highlights how to use the source C++ library as well as the 
Python API generated with the help of SWIG and Boost Python (which is currently
being re-written for v1.0.0). 

The published PyPI package for openGPMP can be 
seen [here](https://pypi.org/project/pygpmp/) soon.
