Welcome to openMTPK's documentation.
===================================
**openMTPK** is a open-source mathematics package written in C++ with language bindings available
for Fortran, OCaml, Python, and R. View the 
The goal is to make a reusable mathematics library allowing users to call within their own projects. 
Starting with some implementations of basics of different mathematical topics like Arithmetic, 
Calculus, Statistics, Linear Algebra, etc. in conjunction with more advanced algorithms seen in 
the blend of such topics, branches of Machine Learning, Image Processing and much more. Some of 
the modules operate in a circular dependant way, for example arithmetic operations seen in linear 
algebra vector operations that can be seen in algorithms implemented in the deep learning module. 
Some of these implementations were first prototypes in Wolfram Mathetmatica, then converted to C++ 
code for the package. Look in the drivers folder for examples on using these tools in your 
own project. This piece of documentation will highlight the modules in use, the 
mathematics/logic behind them, future developments, and more.
